  Core software stack for autonomous vessel research.

- [Template Python Package](https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/template_python_package)
  Suggested boilerplate for creating Python packages.

## Control

- [skadipy](https://github.com/incebellipipo/skadipy)
  Python package for maneuvering-based thrust allocation for marine vessels.

## Simulators

- [shoeboxpy](https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/shoeboxpy)
  Simplified 3-DoF and 6-DoF shoebox vessel models.

- [mcsimpy](https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/mcsimpy)
  High-fidelity simulation framework for select Cybership vessels and R/V Gunnerus.

- [Cybership Stonefish Simulator](https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/cybership_stonefish_common)
  Common interfaces and tools for the Stonefish-based simulation environment.

## Data and Models

- [mcmodels](https://github.com/NTNU-MCS/mcmodels)
  Hydrodynamical model database of vessels in the inventory, including *milliAmpere1*.
